# My Digital CV

Welcome to my digital CV! This project showcases my skills, experience, and achievements in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

Built with React, it offers a modern and engaging way for LinkedIn recruiters to explore my professional profile. Let's dive in and discover what makes me a great fit for your team!

To add color and styling to your digital CV, you can leverage the power of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). GFM supports a variety of formatting options that can make your CV visually appealing. Here are a few examples:

1. **Headers**: Use `#` to create headers of different sizes. For example, `# Introduction` creates a large header, while `## Skills` creates a smaller header.

2. **Lists**: Create bullet or numbered lists using `-` or `1.` respectively. For example:
  - Technical Skills
    - React
    - HTML
    - CSS
  - Soft Skills
    - Communication
    - Problem-solving

3. **Emphasis**: Add emphasis to text using `*` or `_`. For example, `*italic*` or `_italic_` creates italic text, while `**bold**` or `__bold__` creates bold text.

4. **Code Blocks**: Highlight code snippets using bagitckticks (\`). For example:
  ```javascript
  const greeting = "Hello, recruiters!";
  console.log(greeting);
  ```

5. **Links**: Add clickable links using `[text](url)`. For example, `[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)` creates a link to your LinkedIn profile.
